ALL THE HEADER FILES AND OTHER NECESSARY FILES HAVE BEEN ATTACHED TO THE .RAR FILE. EXTRACT THE FILE AND FOLLOW
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN BELOW.

1)	INSIDE THE "ffmpeg" FILE YOU WILL SEE A FILE "ffmpeg.sln". LOAD THAT FILE INTO "VISUAL STUDIO" ANY VERSION AFTER VC14 
	RELEASE (MINE IS 2019 COMMUNITY EDITION). THEN IT WILL LOAD ALL THE STATIC LIBRARIES INCLUDING DYNAMIC HEADER FILES.

2)	a.	SOFTWARE VERSIONS TO DOWNLOAD.
				VISUAL STUDIO	- 2015 OR ANY LATEST VERSION.
				openCV			- openCV-3.4.1
				FFMPEG			- FFMPEG 4.1.3
  	b.	NEXT STEP IS TO INSTALL oprnCV ON YOUR COMPUTER AND ADD THE *"C:\openCV-3.4.1\opencv\build\x64\vc14\bin" TO SYSTEM 
			ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES "Path". (* YOUR DIRECTORIES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM MINE. THERE FORE PLEASE FIND THE bin FILE
			LOCATION WITH "...64x\vc14\bin")

	c.	INSTALL FFMPEG ON YOUR PC AND ADD THE bin DIRECTORY TO THE SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AS **"C:\ffmpeg\bin". (** YOUR 
			DIRECTORIES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM MINE. THERE FORE PLEASE FIND THE bin FILE LOCATION IN THE CORESPONDING FOLDER)
				MOST OF THE TIMES FFMPEG HAS DIFFERENT FILES TO DOWNLAD.
				THE BEST WAY IS -	*First download the "ffmpeg-4.1.3-win64-shared.zip"
									*Then download the "ffmpeg-4.1.3-win64-dev.zip"
									*After that put all the files into a folder in the C: drive. following list shows the file list
									 thet should include in your FFMPEG directory.
										- bin
										- doc
										- example
										- include
										- lib
										- presets
										- LICENSE.txt
										- README.txt
